## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

> For this project, you will pick a dataset. Inspired by Robert, there are a few public datasets from Airbnb available below, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data.

I chose Airbnb data in Seattle, and have the following 3 questions:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?
2. What kinds of Airbnb homes are popular?  
3. What are the key factors which influence the price of a listing?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>
1. January is the busiest season to visit Seattle. July is the second busiest season to visit Seattle.
2. Airbnb homes which have soon response from host or flexible cancellation policy are more popular.
3. Key factors that affect price are number of accomodates, bathrooms, bedrooms and beds.
